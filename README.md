Improved Location app

[Android] Location app that gives user his/her latitude/longitude, address, and shows him/her on a map. Ability to send location details to predefined email address at the press of a button.


***IMPORTANT***
For the app to properly work for you, please change the 'recvMail' variable at line 103 of  /src/apt/kangkan/LocationActivity.java to an email address you want the locations to be sent to.
Currently, it has my email address. So, any updates you send will directly come to my inbox!
